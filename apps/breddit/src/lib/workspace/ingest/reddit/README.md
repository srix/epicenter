# Reddit GDPR Export Ingestion

Imports a Reddit data export ZIP into an Epicenter workspace. Reddit provides your data as a flat ZIP of CSV files when you [request a copy](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043048352).

## Architecture

```
parse.ts        → Phase 1: ZIP → raw CSV records (Record<csvKey, rows[]>)
csv-schemas.ts  → Phase 2: arktype schemas that validate + transform in one pass
workspace.ts    → Workspace definition (tables + KV store)
index.ts        → Orchestrator: wires parse → schema → workspace insertion
```

Large CSV files that Reddit splits into numbered parts (e.g., `post_votes_1.csv`, `post_votes_2.csv`) are automatically detected and concatenated during parsing. UTF-8 BOM is stripped from all decoded files.

## CSV File Reference

A typical Reddit export contains **38 CSV files** (flat, no subdirectories). Every file is accounted for below.

Some exports include `messages.csv` + `message_headers.csv` instead of `messages_archive.csv` + `messages_archive_headers.csv`. The importer handles both variants.

### Tables (24 CSV files → 24 tables)

| CSV File | Table | ID Strategy | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `announcements.csv` | `announcements` | `announcement_id` | Reddit system announcements sent to you |
| `approved_submitter_subreddits.csv` | `approvedSubmitterSubreddits` | `subreddit` value | Subreddits where your posts are auto-approved |
| `chat_history.csv` | `chatHistory` | `message_id` (renamed to `id`) | Reddit chat messages sent/received |
| `comment_votes.csv` | `commentVotes` | Natural `id` | Every comment you upvoted/downvoted |
| `comments.csv` | `comments` | Natural `id` | Every comment you posted |
| `drafts.csv` | `drafts` | Natural `id` | Unsaved post drafts |
| `friends.csv` | `friends` | `username` value | Users you follow |
| `gilded_content.csv` | `gildedContent` | Composite: `link\|date\|award\|amount` | Awards you gave to others |
| `gold_received.csv` | `goldReceived` | Composite: `link\|date\|gold\|gilder` | Awards your content received |
| `hidden_posts.csv` | `hiddenPosts` | Natural `id` | Posts you hid from your feed |
| `messages.csv` | `messages` | Natural `id` | DMs sent/received (some exports use this) |
| `messages_archive.csv` | `messagesArchive` | Natural `id` | DMs sent/received (some exports use this instead) |
| `moderated_subreddits.csv` | `moderatedSubreddits` | `subreddit` value | Subreddits you moderate |
| `multireddits.csv` | `multireddits` | Natural `id` | Custom subreddit groups you created |
| `payouts.csv` | `payouts` | `payout_id` or date fallback | Money Reddit paid you |
| `poll_votes.csv` | `pollVotes` | Composite: `post\|selection\|text\|img\|pred\|stake` | Polls you voted on |
| `post_votes.csv` | `postVotes` | Natural `id` | Every post you upvoted/downvoted |
| `posts.csv` | `posts` | Natural `id` | Every post you submitted |
| `purchases.csv` | `purchases` | `transaction_id` | Reddit purchases you made |
| `saved_comments.csv` | `savedComments` | Natural `id` | Comments you bookmarked |
| `saved_posts.csv` | `savedPosts` | Natural `id` | Posts you bookmarked |
| `scheduled_posts.csv` | `scheduledPosts` | `scheduled_post_id` | Queued future posts (moderator feature) |
| `subscribed_subreddits.csv` | `subscribedSubreddits` | `subreddit` value | Subreddits you're subscribed to |
| `subscriptions.csv` | `subscriptions` | `subscription_id` | Recurring Reddit payment subscriptions |

The `ip` column present in `posts.csv`, `comments.csv`, `messages.csv`, and `messages_archive.csv` is intentionally stripped during ingestion (PII with no workspace value).

### KV Store (2 CSV files → 2 KV entries)

Singleton data (one value per account) goes into the KV store instead of tables.

| CSV File | KV Key | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `statistics.csv` | `statistics` | Account stats as key-value pairs (email, signup date, karma breakdown, etc.) |
| `user_preferences.csv` | `preferences` | Account settings as key-value pairs (language, theme, notification opts, etc.) |

### Excluded Files (14 CSV files, intentionally not stored)

These files are present in Reddit exports but are **not parsed or stored**.

#### Redundant data (no unique content)

| CSV File | Why Excluded |
|---|---|
| `checkfile.csv` | ZIP integrity checksums for tamper verification. Not user data. Only useful at download time to verify the archive wasn't corrupted. |
| `comment_headers.csv` | Strict subset of `comments.csv` (same rows, without the `body` column). 100% redundant. |
| `message_headers.csv` | Strict subset of `messages.csv` (same rows, without the `body` column). 100% redundant. |
| `messages_archive_headers.csv` | Strict subset of `messages_archive.csv` (same rows, without the `body` column). 100% redundant. |
| `post_headers.csv` | Strict subset of `posts.csv` (same rows, without the `body` column). 100% redundant. |

Reddit includes the `*_headers.csv` variants so users can review metadata (dates, subreddits, permalinks) without loading full post/comment/message bodies. Since we import the full files, the headers add zero value.

#### PII and Reddit internals (no workspace value)

| CSV File | Why Excluded |
|---|---|
| `ip_logs.csv` | Login IP history. Purely admin/security data — no one imports a Reddit export to browse their IP log. Reddit retains the registration IP indefinitely (even after account deletion) and other IPs for ~100 days. |
| `sensitive_ads_preferences.csv` | Reddit's internal ad targeting categories. Ad machinery metadata, not user content. |
| `linked_identities.csv` | Opaque OAuth issuer/subject ID pairs from Google/Apple sign-in. Internal identity-linking metadata with no meaning outside Reddit. |
| `linked_phone_number.csv` | Phone number linked to the account. PII with no workspace value — the user already knows their phone number. |
| `stripe.csv` | Opaque Stripe account ID. An internal payment identifier meaningless to the user. |
| `persona.csv` | Opaque Persona KYC verification ID. An internal identity-verification identifier meaningless to the user. |
| `account_gender.csv` | Gender from your profile. Not essential to workspace — you already know your gender. |
| `birthdate.csv` | Birthday and verified birthday status. Not essential to workspace — you already know your birthday. |
| `twitter.csv` | Connected Twitter/X handle. Linked identity metadata with no workspace relevance. |

## All Files Are Optional

The importer is best-effort: it parses every known CSV it finds and defaults missing ones to empty. No files are required. The returned `ImportStats` tell the caller exactly what was found.

One bad row doesn't abort the import. Malformed rows are skipped and reported in `ImportStats.errors` with the table name, row index, and validation error message.
