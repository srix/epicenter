# Hono Factory Pattern Gives You Type-Safe Middleware and Handlers

Define your environment types once, create a factory from them, then use the factory to build every middleware and handler. All your code gets full type inference from that single type definition. No manual `Context<AppEnv>` annotations needed.

```typescript
// 1. Define your environment types in one place
export type Variables = {
  user: { id: string; name: string; email: string };
};

export type AppEnv = { Bindings: Cloudflare.Env; Variables: Variables };

// 2. Create a factory from that type
export const factory = createFactory<AppEnv>();

// 3. Every middleware and handler uses the factory
const sessionMiddleware = factory.createMiddleware(async (c, next) => {
  const session = await auth.api.getSession({ headers: c.req.raw.headers });
  if (session) c.set('user', session.user);  // ✅ c.set validates keys
  return next();
});

// 4. Handlers get the same typing for free
export function createProxyHandler() {
  return factory.createHandlers(async (c) => {
    const apiKey = c.env.OPENAI_API_KEY;  // ✅ typed from generated Cloudflare.Env
    const user = c.var.user;              // ✅ typed as { id, name, email }
    return c.json({ ok: true });
  });
}
```

> **Note:** `Bindings` no longer needs to be manually maintained. Run `wrangler types` to generate a `worker-configuration.d.ts` with a `Cloudflare.Env` namespace derived from your `wrangler.toml`. KV namespaces, Durable Objects, vars, and secrets are all typed automatically.
>
> Similarly, `auth` no longer lives in `Variables`. Since `import { env } from "cloudflare:workers"` gives module-level access to bindings, the auth instance is a module-level singleton — import it directly instead of threading it through middleware and `c.var`.

Compare this to the manual approach. Without the factory, each file imports `Context` and `AppEnv` separately, annotating handlers individually.

```typescript
// Without factory: lots of boilerplate
import type { Context } from 'hono';
import type { AppEnv } from '../worker';

export function createProxyHandler() {
  return async (c: Context<AppEnv>) => {
    const apiKey = c.env.OPENAI_API_KEY;
    return c.json({ ok: true });
  };
}
```

The factory approach wins on three fronts. First, you avoid repeating the same type annotation across dozens of handler files. Second, types propagate automatically from the factory—change `AppEnv` and every handler sees the update. Third, reading `factory.createMiddleware()` immediately signals to readers that this code is part of the typed ecosystem.

```
AppEnv (single source of truth)
  │
  ├─> factory.createApp() ─────────> app.use(), app.get(), etc.
  │
  ├─> factory.createMiddleware() ──> sessionMiddleware, corsMiddleware, etc.
  │
  └─> factory.createHandlers() ────> createProxyHandler(), createChatHandler(), etc.

All four branches inherit the same Bindings and Variables.
```

The factory pattern scales. As your app grows from 2 middleware to 12, the cost of maintaining types stays zero. New files just call `factory.createMiddleware()` and get full typing immediately. No per-file type imports. No manual assertions.

Think of the factory as a "type amplifier." You define types once. The factory broadcasts them everywhere.
