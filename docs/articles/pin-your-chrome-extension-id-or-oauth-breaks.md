# Pin Your Chrome Extension ID or OAuth Breaks

When you're developing a Chrome extension with a framework like WXT, Chrome generates the extension ID from the absolute path of the unpacked extension folder. Different developer, different path, different ID. Every URL tied to that ID—OAuth redirects, `chrome.identity.getRedirectURL()`, externally connectable allowlists—breaks silently.

```
/Users/alice/code/my-ext/.output/chrome-mv3  → ID: abcdefghijklmnop  ✅
/Users/bob/projects/my-ext/.output/chrome-mv3 → ID: qrstuvwxyzabcdef  ❌
```

The fix is a single manifest field. Add a `key` to your manifest, and Chrome derives the ID from that key instead of the filesystem path. Same key in the repo, same ID on every machine.

## Generating a Key

No Chrome Web Store upload needed. Two commands:

```bash
# Generate a private key, extract the public key in Chrome's format
openssl genrsa 2048 > ext-key.pem
openssl rsa -in ext-key.pem -pubout -outform DER 2>/dev/null | base64 | tr -d '\n'
```

That outputs a base64 string starting with `MIIBIj...`. That's your manifest key. You can also compute the resulting extension ID upfront:

```bash
openssl rsa -in ext-key.pem -pubout -outform DER 2>/dev/null \
  | shasum -a 256 | head -c 32 | tr '0-9a-f' 'a-p'
```

Discard the `.pem` after. Chrome only needs the public key in the manifest.

## Adding It in WXT

WXT generates `manifest.json` from `wxt.config.ts`. The `manifest` object accepts any valid Chrome manifest field, and `key` passes through untouched:

```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  manifest: {
    key: 'MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQE...',
    permissions: ['identity'],
  },
});
```

That's it. Every developer who clones the repo gets the same extension ID, the same `chromiumapp.org` redirect URL, and OAuth just works.
