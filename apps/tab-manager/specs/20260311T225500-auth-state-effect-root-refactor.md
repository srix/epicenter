# Auth State: Internalize Reactive Lifecycle with $effect.root

**Date**: 2026-03-11
**Status**: Implemented
**Author**: AI-assisted

## Overview

Replace the two "call me inside $effect" methods (`reactToTokenCleared`, `reactToTokenSet`) in `auth.svelte.ts` with internal `$effect.root()` effects that the auth state module manages itself. Consumers no longer participate in the auth state machine—they subscribe to events.

## Motivation

### Current State

The auth state singleton exposes two methods that only work when called inside a `$effect`:

```typescript
// auth.svelte.ts
reactToTokenCleared() {
    if (!authToken.current && phase.status === 'signed-in') {
        void authUser.set(undefined);
        phase = { status: 'signed-out' };
    }
},
reactToTokenSet() {
    if (authToken.current && authUser.current && phase.status === 'signed-out') {
        phase = { status: 'signed-in' };
        return true;
    }
    return false;
},
```

The sole consumer wires them up in `App.svelte`:

```svelte
$effect(() => {
    authState.reactToTokenCleared();
    if (authState.reactToTokenSet()) reconnectSync();
});
```

This creates problems:

1. **Implicit contract**: Nothing in the type signature enforces that these must be called inside `$effect`. The JSDoc says "Call this inside a $effect" but that's a comment, not a guarantee. If someone calls them from a plain function, they silently do nothing.
2. **Leaky abstraction**: The auth module's internal state transitions (signed-in → signed-out, signed-out → signed-in) are exposed as public API. The consumer has to understand the auth state machine to use it correctly.
3. **Coupled concerns**: `reconnectSync()` (a workspace concern) is tangled into auth's reactive lifecycle via a boolean return value.
4. **Fragile**: Both methods run inside a single `$effect` block. Svelte tracks all reactive reads in the block as dependencies. If either method reads a new `$state` in the future, the entire effect re-runs for both conditions—potentially causing unexpected behavior.

### Desired State

Auth state manages its own reactive lifecycle internally. Consumers subscribe to events they care about:

```svelte
<!-- App.svelte -->
<script lang="ts">
    import { onMount } from 'svelte';

    onMount(() => {
        authState.checkSession();
        const unsub = authState.onExternalSignIn(() => reconnectSync());
        return unsub;
    });
    // No $effect block needed
</script>
```

## Design Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Effect scope mechanism | `$effect.root()` inside `createAuthState()` | Module-level singleton has no component context; `$effect.root()` is the Svelte 5 API for exactly this case |
| Cleanup of root effects | None (intentional) | Singleton lives for the JS context lifetime; cleanup is the tab/window closing. See existing article: `your-spa-singleton-doesnt-need-effect-cleanup.md` |
| External sign-in notification | `onExternalSignIn(callback)` returning unsubscribe | Clean separation—auth manages state, consumer decides what to do about it (e.g. reconnect sync) |
| External sign-out notification | No separate callback | Token cleared → phase goes to signed-out. Consumers already read `authState.status` reactively. No callback needed unless a specific side effect is required |
| Callback invocation safety | `untrack()` around callback execution | Prevents callbacks from accidentally creating reactive dependencies inside the effect body |

## Safety Analysis

This section documents every concern we considered and why each is safe.

### No premature firing on initialization

`phase` starts as `{ status: 'checking' }`. Neither effect condition matches:
- Token cleared effect requires `phase.status === 'signed-in'` → false during 'checking'
- Token set effect requires `phase.status === 'signed-out'` → false during 'checking'

The effects are inert until `checkSession()` resolves and sets a definitive phase.

### No infinite loops (self-stabilizing effects)

**Token cleared effect**: reads `authToken.current` and `phase.status`. Writes `phase = { status: 'signed-out' }`. On the re-run triggered by the phase write, the condition `phase.status === 'signed-in'` is now false. Effect exits. Stable.

**Token set effect**: reads `authToken.current`, `authUser.current`, and `phase.status`. Writes `phase = { status: 'signed-in' }`. On the re-run, `phase.status === 'signed-out'` is false. Effect exits. Stable.

### No cross-effect loops

The two effects have mutually exclusive activation conditions based on token presence:
- Token cleared fires when `!authToken.current` (token absent) AND `phase.status === 'signed-in'`
- Token set fires when `authToken.current` (token present) AND `phase.status === 'signed-out'`

If effect 1 sets phase to `signed-out`, effect 2 would need a truthy token to fire—but effect 1 only fires when token is falsy. If effect 2 sets phase to `signed-in`, effect 1 would need a falsy token—but effect 2 only fires when token is truthy. They can never trigger each other.

### No race with checkSession()

`checkSession()` is async. While it runs, phase is `'checking'`. Neither effect fires during `'checking'`. Once `checkSession()` sets a definitive phase, the effects respond correctly to the current token state. No interleaving concern.

### No race with signIn()/signUp()/signOut()

These methods set phase to `'signing-in'` or `'signing-out'` during their operation. Neither effect fires during these transitional states—they only match `'signed-in'` and `'signed-out'`. Once the method completes and sets the final phase, the effects align with the token state at that moment.

### No accidental dependencies from callbacks

`reconnectSync()` is `workspaceClient.extensions.sync.reconnect()`—a one-liner that reads no reactive state. However, future callbacks might read `$state` values. Wrapping callback invocation in `untrack()` prevents any callback from accidentally becoming a dependency of the effect:

```typescript
$effect(() => {
    if (authToken.current && authUser.current && phase.status === 'signed-out') {
        phase = { status: 'signed-in' };
        untrack(() => {
            for (const fn of externalSignInListeners) fn();
        });
    }
});
```

This is a defensive measure. Current consumers don't need it, but it prevents a subtle bug if a future callback reads reactive state.

### No memory leak

`$effect.root()` returns a cleanup function, but we intentionally don't call it. The auth state singleton lives for the entire JS context (browser extension sidepanel). When the context dies, everything—effects, listeners, state—is garbage collected together. This matches the existing pattern in `createStorageState`, which uses `item.watch()` without cleanup.

### No cleanup concern for listener Set

`externalSignInListeners` is a `Set<() => void>`. Subscribers call the returned unsubscribe function in their `onMount` cleanup. If they don't (e.g. another module-level singleton subscribes permanently), that's also fine—the Set lives as long as the auth state, which lives as long as the JS context.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Refactor auth state internals

- [x] **1.1** Add `$effect.root()` block inside `createAuthState()` with two internal effects (token cleared, token set)
- [x] **1.2** Add `externalSignInListeners` Set and `onExternalSignIn(callback)` method to the return object
- [x] **1.3** Remove `reactToTokenCleared()` and `reactToTokenSet()` from the return object

### Phase 2: Update consumer

- [x] **2.1** In `App.svelte`, remove the `$effect` block (lines 37-40)
- [x] **2.2** Add `authState.onExternalSignIn(() => reconnectSync())` inside the existing `onMount`, returning the unsubscribe in cleanup

### Phase 3: Verify

- [ ] **3.1** Test: sign in via email → verify phase transitions
- [ ] **3.2** Test: sign in via Google → verify phase transitions
- [ ] **3.3** Test: sign out → verify clearState and phase reset
- [ ] **3.4** Test: open two sidepanels → sign in in one → verify the other transitions to signed-in and reconnects sync
- [ ] **3.5** Test: open two sidepanels → sign out in one → verify the other transitions to signed-out
- [x] **3.6** LSP diagnostics clean on `auth.svelte.ts` and `App.svelte`

## Edge Cases

### Token and user arrive at different times from another context

1. Another context calls `signIn()`, which writes `authUser` first via `authUser.set(user)`, then the `onSuccess` callback writes `authToken` via the `set-auth-token` header
2. After `authUser` is set but before `authToken` arrives, the token set effect checks `authToken.current && authUser.current && phase.status === 'signed-out'`. Token is still falsy → effect doesn't fire
3. Once `authToken` arrives, both conditions are met → effect fires → transition to signed-in

This is the same behavior as the current implementation. The conditions naturally handle partial state.

### URL changes while signed in

1. User changes `remoteServerUrl` in settings
2. `$derived` creates a new `client` instance
3. Existing session is still valid; `authToken` and `authUser` unchanged
4. Next API call uses the new client with the existing token

No impact on the refactored code—`$derived` on `client` is unchanged.

## Success Criteria

- [x] `reactToTokenCleared()` and `reactToTokenSet()` removed from public API
- [x] No `$effect` block in `App.svelte` for auth lifecycle management
- [ ] Cross-context sign-in/sign-out still works (token changes in one panel are reflected in another) *(requires manual testing)*
- [ ] `reconnectSync()` still fires on external sign-in *(requires manual testing)*
- [x] LSP diagnostics pass on all changed files

## Review

**Completed**: 2026-03-11

### Summary

Internalized auth state's reactive lifecycle by replacing the two public `reactToTokenCleared()`/`reactToTokenSet()` methods with `$effect.root()` effects inside `createAuthState()`. Added `onExternalSignIn(callback)` subscription method so consumers can react to cross-context sign-ins without understanding the auth state machine. App.svelte now uses a simple `onMount` subscription instead of a raw `$effect` block.

### Deviations from Spec

None—implementation matched the spec exactly.

### Follow-up Work

- Manual testing items 3.1–3.5 (sign-in/sign-out flows, cross-context sync) need human verification
